                        He is one of the robbers of the Royal Mint of Spain and the Bank of Spain. In the Royal Mint heist, Helsinki was mainly in charge of watching over the hostages, teasing Arturo, and chatting with Oslo. In the second season, he suffocated Oslo, who was in a vegetative state.<br>
                        Helsinki was born in Serbia. He was a soldier in the Yugoslav Wars with his cousin Oslo. He has a family in Serbia, to whom he sends money when he can.

                       During the war, he had a bullet taken out of him in a tractor garage.
                       Helsinki likes to make Arturo nervous, often belittling him by calling him "Arturito". In the last hours of the robbery, he covered him with fake explosives to scare him.

                        Oslo was born on November 17th, 1974 in Belgrade, Serbia.Oslo seems to have a no-nonsense attitude to work. Oslo fought in the Balkan Wars with his cousin Helsinki. Oslo died on October 24, 2016 at the age of 41<br>
                        Oslo and cousin Helsinki act as hired guns and the muscle during the heist. They're usually seen acting as crowd control. They don't really think independently, and mostly just follow orders. Oslo and Helsinki helped Berlin to punish Rio in Part 1 Episode 3, and are also seen aiming guns at Denver and Nairobi during a standoff with Berlin in Part 1 Episode 9.

                        Bogotá is the worlds best welder and has a vital role in the heist at the Bank of Spain. He is the main member in charge alongside Nairobi to lead the group that is melting the gold bricks in the national reserve into grains of gold at the Bank of Spain. It is through his talents of welding that the team is able to pull-off the successful extraction of the gold from the flooded vault. His welding and heroic efforts (placing a bomb underwater while being present in the enclosed vault, welding underwater without an oxygen tank) allow the heist to move forward as planned initially.

                        better known by his code name Marseille, is a character in the Money Heist series.
                        He appears as a recurring character in season 3 and as one of the main characters in season 4. He has never entered in the bank but helps the gang and the Professor from the outside. <br>
                        Not much is known about Marseille's early life. It was mentioned that he was a hitman. The only family he spoke of was his late dog,
                        He would never hurt an animal.
                        He has a pet ferret named Sofía.
                        Marseille was a friend of Berlin, as we see him at Berlin and Tatiana's wedding. At Berlin's Wedding, Marsielle dances with the Professor, Bogotá, Tatiana, and Berlin.
                        Marseille crashes his car to make it look like the Professor was badly hurt. He is seen doing everything he can to help the Professor. He eventually goes to Algeria for the Professor to capture and record damning evidence against the police and the Spanish government.

                        <a rel=nofollow href=https://money-heist.fandom.com/wiki/Manila target="_blank">Julia</a> is also known by her code name, Manila, is a character in the Netflix series Money Heist, portrayed by actress Belén Cuesta.<br>
                        Born as Juan, her father Benjamin is a close friend of Moscow. She and Denver have been close friends since childhood, with Moscow mentioning how they were like siblings. Because she is a transgender individual, she eventually transitioned as Julia, which Denver and Moscow did not know about until they saw her again. She changed her gender, which she revealed to Denver and Moscow in Part 3.

                        Moscow requested that she join the gang when they were planning the robbery of the Royal Mint of Spain in Toledo. Julia joined the crew of robbers as requested by Moscow and Denver to The Professor, as they promised her father, Benjamin, that they would take care of her.<br>

                        Although she was not included in the Royal Mint of Spain robbery, she did participate in the Bank of Spain heist. Her task consists of being among the other hostages, pretending to be one of them as a form of crowd control.<br> 
                         Arturo grabs Matías' gun, but is shot by Manila with a pistol Denver gave her earlier, revealing herself to be an undercover robber.

                        <a rel=nofollow href=https://money-heist.fandom.com/wiki/Mat%C3%ADas_Ca%C3%B1o target="_blank"> Matías Caño</a> is 
                        a supporting character who appears in the Bank of Spain robbery in Parts 3 and 4. He helps the gang out with melting and storing the gold and also guards the hostages and has been an associate of Bogotá for six years.<br>
                        In his first appearance in the third episode, he is 'picked' as one of the 'volunteers' to work in the gold production area. He refuses to do it by saying he is 'no volunteer' which angers Nairobi and results in Bogotá dragging him downstairs to the other hostages' horror. It is later revealed that was all an act and that he is in on the heist and one of the undercover members hired to help the main gang out.

                        He spends the majority of Part 3 working in the gold shaft along with Nairobi, Bogotá and the other volunteers. He also assists the gang in helping to recover the Governor.<br>
                        He stays downstairs with the hostages and stands in front of them, holding his gun at all times. When Arturo Román caused a commotion amongst the hostages, Matías approached him to warn him but was disarmed by Arturo. However, Manila, one of the hostages, revealed herself to have been an undercover agent of the gang, and almost immediately disposed of Arturo by shooting him in the leg and lending Matías his gun back.<br>
